                <h3>The Keros Project</h3>
                <p>Four and a half thousand years ago, in the Early Bronze Age (ca. 2800BC to 2200 BCE), the remote and now uninhabited island of Keros, in the middle of the Cyclades, Greece, was the site of an <b>extraordinary florescence of human imagination, creativity and ingenuity</b>. 
                    Here, in the most unlikely of places, people came together to craft the basic principles of a completely new kind of society – <b>the dawn of the modern world</b>. Through co-operation, connectivity and communication they created the <b>world’s first information age</b>, drawing in participants from across the Cyclades and beyond, and on Keros itself they created the most ambitious way of life yet seen in the region, with monumental architecture, urban planning, high technology production, and complex vertical and horizontal social structures. 
                    Keros became the <b>blueprint for the emergence of civilisation</b> in the eastern Mediterranean, the harbinger of future Minoan and Mycenaean societies and even the early Greek polis. The Keros Project, led by science, is dedicated to the in-depth investigation of the world that Keros created.</p>

                    The site first came to prominence in the 1960s, when Colin Renfrew and Christos Doumas (separately) visited the site and discovered that part of it had been subject to looting. The looted area was first investigated archaeologically in 1963 by Doumas.
                    Further investigation of the site was carried out in 1967 by Zapheiropoulou and in 1987 by Renfrew, Doumas and Marangou. Publication of this work followed in 2007.
                    Since then three major international collaborative projects have been carried out on Keros. These projects have completely transformed our understanding of what was previously seen as a Cycladic enigma.
                    The work done has defined the site as central in the networks of the Early Bronze Age, a centre of congregation for long-lived pan-Cycladic ritual practices as well as a centre of power where the greatest architectural undertakings of the age housed centralised craft practices, set in a landscape of intensified agricultural innovations and satellite settlements.

                    <p>Looters damaged Keros in the years before 1963, but early rescue work showed the site to be unusual in nature, with lots of broken marble figurines and vessels. Scientific work in 2006-2008 showed that Kavos area on the west coast of Keros was site of two ‘special deposits’, areas where people deliberately (and probably ritually) deposited broken choice material over a period of three centuries or more. The analysis of these data shows that Kavos was the site of the world’s earliest maritime sanctuary. Click here to learn what that means, and much more about the two special deposits. </p>

                        <p>Dhaskalio, now a tiny islet just off the west coast of Keros, was joined to Kavos and the area of the special deposits by a causeway in the Early Bronze Age, as the sea level was lower then. Recent work on Dhaskalio has revealed unprecedented monumental architecture, and remarkably precocious evidence for metalworking. Now we are beginning to understand that the story of Keros includes intensive periods of production of prestigious objects like daggers, which might have been just as potent symbols for the Cycladic islanders as the marble figurines were.

                        <p>One important question is the relationship between Kavos and Dhaskalio: how were the activities of production on Dhaskalio interrelated with the apparently more ritual activities on Kavos? But another, similar, question is the relationship between the Dhaskalio and Kavos complex and larger areas: the island of Keros, for example, or the nearby islands, or the wider world of the Cyclades and the Aegean? In order to investigate this question we conducted a series of larger-scale surface investigations (surveys) on Keros itself, nearby Kato Kouphonisi, and in the southeast coastal region of Naxos.

                    <p>
                        Keros, uninhabited, remote and difficult to visit, was nonetheless known to the archaeological world since the nineteenth century, due to the discovery there of three remarkable examples of Cycladic sculpture: the head of an almost life-size female figure, <a href="https://collections.louvre.fr/en/ark:/53355/cl010276544" target = "_blank">now in the Louvre</a>, and two much smaller depictions of musicians: the famous harpist and pipe-player, <a href="https://www.namuseum.gr/en/collection/syllogi-kykladikon-archaiotiton/" target = "_blank">now in the National Archaeological Museum, Athens</a>.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Archaeological work began in 1963 after a serious episode of looting. Christos Doumas and Colin Renfrew both visited the site separately in the summer, recording ‘catastrophic’ looting, and Doumas undertook a short rescue excavation in the autumn. This was followed by a larger rescue excavation in 1967 by Photeini Zapheiropoulou and Konstantinos Tsakos. Both these excavations recovered a surprising range of material: numerous examples of the well-known Cycladic figurines, all broken; thousands of fragments of marble bowls and other types of stone vessels, also in broken condition; and large amounts of pottery which proved during the much later study (by Peggy Sotirakopoulou) to be dominated by two particular shapes: the so-called sauceboats, and conical necked jars, perhaps associated with commensal activities. Nothing indicative of everyday life was found, nor any architectural structures, which led to a sense of mystery about the nature of the site.</a>  
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        By 1987 Colin Renfrew had determined that further work was necessary to understand the nature of what was clearly an unusual site. Was it a cemetery, utterly destroyed by the looters? Or was it some kind of sanctuary where choice materials were deliberately deposited? Renfrew with colleagues Doumas and Lila Marangou undertook further excavations in the looted area, calling it the ‘Special Deposit’ (and now referred to as the Special Deposit North). Meanwhile Todd Whitelaw organised a surface survey of a larger area around the Special Deposit, collecting all the archaeological finds on the surface to try to understand potential different functions around what appeared to be a large site. Renfrew, studying the breakages on the marble finds, came to the conclusion that the great majority of breakages happened in antiquity, not at the hands of the looters, and that therefore the site was not likely to be a cemetery.
                        <br><br>
                        The first major scientific investigation of Keros began in 2006, when Renfrew led a team to investigate other parts of the site, following up on the results of Whitelaw’s survey. Whitelaw had thought that perhaps a large settlement was to be found to the south of the Special Deposit North, but from the first days of the excavation, further discoveries of broken marble sculptures and vessels made it clear that a second special deposit, the ‘Special Deposit South’, was located about 110m south of the Special Deposit North. The really important thing about this discovery was that the looters had not found this site. It was preserved in pristine condition, and could be excavated with scientific rigour.
                        <br><br>
                        Just like the Special Deposit North, the new deposit contained marble sculpture fragments, broken marble bowls, and pottery again dominated by the sauceboats and jars, along with thousands of fragments of obsidian, a black volcanic glass imported from Melos in the western Cyclades (and sometimes from sources much further away). The key discovery with the unlooted site was that the broken pieces could not be joined together with other parts – usually only one single fragment of any individual item was included, and even in the rare cases where two pieces joined, they only joined to make a larger fragment, not a whole object. This led Renfrew to the important conclusion that the objects were imported to Keros already broken: the breakages happened elsewhere, on different islands in local ceremonies, and individual pieces were brought to Keros for deposition. Thus Keros could indeed be regarded as the world’s earliest maritime sanctuary, a ‘centre of congregation’ to which Cycladic islanders, and occasional visitors from elsewhere, came to interact and carry out their rituals, which resulted in the depositions of broken materials. However strange this may seem, this turned out to be only a part of the story of Keros...

                        Doumas excavated on Dhaskalio for a few days in September 1963, enough to confirm the presence of Early Bronze Age buildings. Scientific study began in 2007 with the first of five excavation seasons (2007-08, and 2016-18). At first, work concentrated on the summit of the site. A series of buildings was excavated along the narrow summit, including ‘the Hall’, a long, narrow building at the north end of the summit, which must have been very prominent approaching from the sea, did not appear to be domestic, and could have had an organising role in the site. Radiocarbon dates suggested three phases between 2750 BCE and 2250 BCE. Most of the buildings on the summit seemed to be of the last phase.
                        <br><br>
                        In the recent excavations, trenches were placed around the northwest, northeast and east of Dhaskalio. These uncovered much more of the buildings of Phases A and B, and have allowed us to chart the development of the site and its layout. Dhaskalio is very rocky and steep-sided, and not at first glance an ideal location for a dense series of buildings. The ingenious Early Cycladic islanders dealt with this problem by constructing a series of huge stone terraces around the east and north of the promontory. These created a concentric layout, with enough flat space between each terrace to construct buildings. Remarkably, while the massive terraces were built of local stone, for the actual buildings they chose to bring fine building marble from Naxos, some 10km distant. We have calculated that at least 10,000 tonnes of marble were imported from Naxos to build the Dhaskalio complex, which indicates considerable resources in terms of people, infrastructure, and social control, as well as planning. Other indications of planning are in the layout of the terraces, built in advance of the actual buildings, the creation of entranceways (we excavated two, one at the bottom of the site and a monumental and impressive one near the top), a pre-planned system of drainage under houses, pathways and through walls, and the arrangement of routes of movement in general. Dhaskalio, in its heyday, must have been extremely impressive to approach, either by sea or land: the freshly cut marble glinting in the sun, and the impression of monumentality given by some of the massive terrace walls.
                        <br><br>
                        The earliest activity on the site seems, however, to have been the practice of metallurgy. Colin Renfrew had long thought that the mining, production and exchange of metals and metal objects was key to the social revolution of the third millennium BCE, but no really impressive metalworking centre had previously been located in the Cyclades. On Dhaskalio we located several metallurgy workshops, complete with hearths, moulds for objects such as daggers, and other finds related to the metallurgical process. Tiny amounts of gold and silver were also found, with some evidence (currently being studied) that silver was produced on site. The important transition from using copper containing arsenic to using bronze (copper with tin) can also be documented from the finds. All of the metalworking evidence is currently under study by scientists at <a href = src"https://leventis-chair.cyi.ac.cy/the-keros-project/" target="_blank">The Cyprus Institute </a href>.
                        <br><br>
                        Overall Dhaskalio seems to be something other than a ‘normal’ settlement:<strong> it seems to be a specialised complex for craft activities, especially metalworking, but also obsidian working, and perhaps others yet to be discovered.</strong> It seems not to be a place for normal, everyday living, with little evidence for domestic activities. This prompts the question of how such a dense complex of buildings, and the human beings it was designed to contain, with their daily needs for water and food, sustained itself over such a long period of time.

                    <h3 class="text-center section-padding">Keros as Nexus</h3>
                    <p>
                        The reliance of the people working at Dhaskalio on imported materials matches the completely imported nature of the materials deposited in the sanctuary. All of the pottery, the most common material on both sites, as well as almost everything else, was imported. Scientific analysis of the clays of the pottery can help us pinpoint the different islands from which the pottery came. All of this tells us that, as central as Keros was, it was part of larger systems of circulation, exchange and information which it is crucial for us to understand. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        To investigate these we designed a series of surface investigations (commonly called ‘surveys’), where archaeologists examine much larger areas than can be investigated during an excavation, which is time-consuming, detailed and necessarily limited in scale. In surveys, archaeologists systematically walk across a landscape, recording everything that is visible on the surface, without any digging. Mapping, geomorphology and other wide scale techniques will also be used. We used these approaches to survey the whole of the island of Keros (in 2012-13), the nearby island of Kato Kouphonisi (in 2018) and the southeast coastal area of Naxos in 2015. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <strong>On Keros itself</strong>, a major question was whether the sanctuary was isolated or whether it was part of a settlement system. The results of the survey showed unequivocally that it was the latter. Although Keros seems unlikely ever to have been very productive agriculturally, traces of ancient terracing systems, some of which are Early Bronze Age in date, show that the island was exploited. Moreover, a small site dating from just before the sanctuary, shows that Keros was inhabited before it became the centre of the Keros nexus.
                        <br><br>
                        <strong>On Kato Kouphonisi</strong>, much denser surface material seems to confirm the likelihood of a close link between the two islands, whereby much of the domestic and agricultural activity could have been undertaken on Kato Kouphonisi (and most probably also on nearby Ano Kouphonisi), a distributed mode of habitation underpinned by a taskscape encompassing all three islands.
                        <br><br>
                        Meanwhile, <strong>on Naxos</strong> a different settlement pattern was revealed, much more nucleated, and with significantly less suggestion of intensive land use. It may be that Naxos represents a different level of interaction with Keros, less immediate and everyday, although still very closely connected. The study and interpretation of all of the data generated by the surveys is still ongoing.
